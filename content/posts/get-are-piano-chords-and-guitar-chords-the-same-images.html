                Well, a guitar generally won&#039;t be able to play the same exact voicings as the piano because we only have six strings so we can only play six notes at a time. The chord analyzer instantly shows correct chord names, notes and intervals if the bass tone is the same as the lowest tone of the chord shape and the chord symbol seems too complex or doesn&#039;t make sense theoretically, you. Why all this emphasis on primary make the 1st chord of the piece your 1 chord and make sure each chord contains the same note that is in the melody line.
    </p>

    <h3>You won&#039;t be able to play all of each song with them in most cases, but you should be able to work out the rest.</h3>
    <p>The chord on the piano and guitar are the same as far as i&#039;m concerned. While the two instruments are very different, harmony is the same, it&#039;s just the way in which the notes are mapped out on each instrument which makes the difference. You can use the app as a chord guide, listen to how a given chord should sound on the guitar and on the piano. They are 3 note chords.</p>
